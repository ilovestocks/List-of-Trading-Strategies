Go long three currencies with the highest central bank prime rates and go short three currencies with the lowest central bank prime rates. The cash not used as the margin is invested in overnight rates. The strategy is rebalanced monthly.,0.292,29.50%
7,Low Volatility Factor Effect in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of global large-cap stocks (or US large-cap stocks). At the end of each month, the investor constructs equally weighted decile portfolios by ranking the stocks on the past three-year volatility of weekly returns. The investor goes long stocks in the top decile (stocks with the lowest volatility).",0.823,46.90%

Rebalance monthly.,-0.018,40.60%
9,Currency Value Factor – PPP Strategy,Create an investment universe consisting of several currencies (10-20). Use the latest OECD Purchasing Power Parity figure to assess the fair value of each currency versus USD in the month of publishing and then use monthly CPI changes and exchange rate changes to create fair PPP value for the month prior to the current month.

12,Pairs Trading with Stocks,"The investment universe consists of stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, while illiquid stocks are removed from the investment universe. Cumulative total return index is then created for each stock (dividends included), and the starting price during the formation period is set to $1 (price normalization). Pairs are formed over twelve months (formation period) and are then traded in the next six-month period (trading period). The matching partner for each stock is found by looking for the security that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between two normalized price series. Top 20 pairs with the smallest historical distance measure are then traded, and a long-short position is opened when pair prices have diverged by two standard deviations, and the position is closed when prices revert.",0.639,30.80%
13,Short Term Reversal Effect in Stocks,The investment universe consists of the 100 biggest companies by market capitalization. The investor goes long on the ten stocks with the lowest performance in the previous week and goes short on the ten stocks with the greatest performance of the prior month. The portfolio is rebalanced weekly.,0.941,40.00%
14,Momentum Factor Effect in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. We define momentum as the past 12-month return, skipping the most recent month’s return (to avoid microstructure and liquidity biases).

20,Volatility Risk Premium Effect,"Each month, at-the-money straddle, with one month until maturity, is sold at the bid price with a 5% option premium, and an offsetting 15% out-of-the-money puts are bought (at the ask price) as insurance against a market crash. The remaining cash and received option premium are invested in the index. The strategy is rebalanced monthly.",0.934,30.00%
21,Momentum Effect in Commodities,Create a universe of tradable commodity futures. Rank futures performance for each commodity for the last 12 months and divide them into quintiles. Go long on the quintile with the highest momentum and go short on the quintile with the lowest momentum. Rebalance each month.,0.181,70.70%
22,Term Structure Effect in Commodities,This simple strategy buys each month the 20% of commodities with the highest roll-returns and shorts the 20% of commodities with the lowest roll-returns and holds the long-short positions for one month. The contracts in each quintile are equally-weighted. The investment universe is all commodity futures contracts.,0.442,38.70%
25,Size Factor – Small Capitalization Stocks Premium,"The investment universe contains all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. Decile portfolios are formed based on the market capitalization of stocks. To capture “size” effect, SMB portfolio goes long small stocks (lowest decile) and short big stocks (highest decile).",0.866,37.30%
26,Value (Book-to-Market) Factor,"The investment universe contains all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. To represent “value” investing, HML portfolio goes long high book-to-price stocks and short, low book-to-price stocks. In this strategy, we show the results for regular HML which is simply the average of the portfolio returns of HML small (which goes long cheap and short expensive only among small stocks) and HML large (which goes long cheap and short expensive only among large caps). The portfolio is equal-weighted and rebalanced monthly.",0.528,63.10%
28,Value and Momentum Factors across Asset Classes,"Create an investment universe containing investable asset classes (could be US large-cap, mid-cap stocks, US REITS, UK, Japan, Emerging market stocks, US treasuries, US Investment grade bonds, US high yield bonds, Germany bonds, Japan bonds, US cash) and find a good tracking vehicle for each asset class (best vehicles are ETFs or index funds). Momentum ranking is done on price series. Valuation ranking is done on adjusted yield measure for each asset class. E/P (Earning/Price) measure is used for stocks, and YTM (Yield-to-maturity) is used for bonds. US, Japan, and Germany treasury yield are adjusted by -1%, US investment-grade bonds are adjusted by -2%, US High yield bonds are adjusted by -6%, emerging markets equities are adjusted by -1%, and US REITs are adjusted by -2% to get unbiased structural yields for each asset class. Rank each asset class by 12-month momentum, 1-month momentum, and by valuation and weight all three strategies (25% weight to 12m momentum, 25% weight to 1-month momentum, 50% weight to value strategy). Go long top quartile portfolio and go short bottom quartile portfolio.",0.228,24.60%
31,Market Seasonality Effect in World Equity Indexes,"Be invested in global equity markets during November – April period, stay in cash during May-October period (alternatively go long in stocks from countries from northern hemisphere during winter period and long in stocks from countries from southern hemisphere during summer period; alternatively go long in cyclical companies during winter period and short defensive stocks and switch positions during the summer period)",0.434,36.60%
33,Post-Earnings Announcement Effect,"The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ except financial and utility firms and stocks with prices less than $5. Two factors are used: EAR (Earnings Announcement Return) and SUE (Standardized Unexpected Earnings). SUE is constructed by dividing the earnings surprise (calculated as actual earnings minus expected earnings; expected earnings are computed using a seasonal random walk model with drift) by the standard deviation of earnings surprises. EAR is the abnormal return for firms recorded over a three-day window centered on the last announcement date, in excess of the return of a portfolio of firms with similar risk exposures.
Stocks are sorted into quintiles based on the EAR and SUE. To avoid look-ahead bias, data from the previous quarter are used to sort stocks. Stocks are weighted equally in each quintile. The investor goes long stocks from the intersection of top SUE and EAR quintiles and goes short stocks from the intersection of the bottom SUE and EAR quintiles the second day after the actual earnings announcement and holds the portfolio one quarter (or 60 working days). The portfolio is rebalanced every quarter.",0.059,39.50%
36,Net Payout Yield Effect,"he investment universe consists of all stocks on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. At the end of June of each year t, ten portfolios are formed based on ranked values net payout yield. The net payout yield is the ratio of dividends plus repurchases minus common share issuances in year t to year-end market capitalization. There are two measures of payout yield, one based on the statement of cash flows, the other based on the change in Treasury stocks. For the net payout yield, we use the cash flow-based measure of repurchases. The portfolio with the highest net payout yield is bought and held for one year, after which it is rebalanced.",0.434,54.00%
37,Net Current Asset Value Effect,The investment universe consists of all stocks on the London Exchange. Companies with more than one class of ordinary shares and foreign companies are excluded. Also excluded are companies on the lightly regulated markets and companies which belong to the financial sector. The portfolio of stocks is formed annually in July. Only those stocks with an NCAV/MV higher than 1.5 are included in the NCAV/MV portfolio. This Buy-and-hold portfolio is held for one year. Stocks are weighted equally.,1.119,76.30%
38,Accrual Anomaly,"The investment universe consists of all stocks on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. Balance sheet based accruals (the non-cash component of earnings) are calculated as:
BS_ACC = ( ∆CA – ∆Cash) – ( ∆CL – ∆STD – ∆ITP) – Dep
Where:
∆CA = annual change in current assets
∆Cash = change in cash and cash equivalents
∆CL = change in current liabilities
∆STD = change in debt included in current liabilities
∆ITP = change in income taxes payable
Dep = annual depreciation and amortization expense
Stocks are then sorted into deciles and investor goes long stocks with the lowest accruals and short stocks with the highest accruals. The portfolio is rebalanced yearly during May (after all companies publish their earnings).",-0.354,79.50%
41,Turn of the Month in Equity Indexes,Buy SPY ETF 1 day (some papers say 4 days) before the end of the month and sell the 3rd trading day of the new month at the close.,0.361,24.60%

44,Paired Switching,"This strategy is very flexible. Investors could use stocks, funds, or ETFs as an investment vehicle. We show simple trading rules for a sample strategy from the source research paper.

The investor uses two Vanguard funds as his investment vehicles – one equity fund (VFINX) and one government bond fund (VUSTX). These two funds have a negative correlation as they are proxies for two negatively correlated asset classes. The investor looks at the performance of the two funds over the prior quarter and buys the fund that has a higher return during the ranking period. The position is held for one quarter (the investment period). At the end of the investment period, the cycle is repeated.",0.634,34.40%
45,Short Interest Effect – Long-Short Version,"All stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ are part of the investment universe. Stocks are then sorted each month into short-interest deciles based on the ratio of short interest to shares outstanding. The investor then goes long on the decile with the lowest short ratio and short on the decile with the highest short ratio. The portfolio is rebalanced monthly, and stocks in the portfolio are weighted equally.",-0.056,27.70%
46,Short Interest Effect – Long Only version,"All stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ are part of the investment universe. The short-interest ratio is used as the predictor variable. Stocks are sorted based on their short interest ratio, and the first percentile is held. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced monthly.",0.872,34.40%
50,FED Model,"Each month, the investor conducts a one-month predictive regression (using all available data up to that date) predicting excess stock market returns using the yield gap as an independent variable. The “Yield gap” is calculated as YG = EY − y, with earnings yield EY ≡ ln (1 ++ E/P) and y = ln (1 ++ Y) is the log 10 year Treasury bond yield. Then, the strategy allocates 100% in the risky asset if the forecasted excess returns are positive, and otherwise, it invests 100% in the risk-free rate.",0.441,50.30%
52,Asset Growth Effect,"The investment universe consists of all non-financial U.S. stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. Stocks are then sorted each year at the end of June into ten equal groups based on the percentage change in total assets for the previous year. The investor goes long decile with low asset growth firms and short decile with high asset growth firms. The portfolio is weighted equally and rebalanced every year.",1.034,22.40%
55,Pairs Trading with Country ETFs,"The investment universe consists of 22 international ETFs. A normalized cumulative total return index is created for each ETF (dividends included), and the starting price during the formation period is set to $1 (price normalization). The selection of pairs is made after a 120 day formation period. Pair’s distance for all ETF pairs is calculated as the sum of squared deviations between two normalized price series. The top 5 pairs with the smallest distance are used in the subsequent 20 day trading period. The strategy is monitored daily, and trade is opened when the divergence between the pairs exceeds 0.5x the historical standard deviation. Investors go long on the undervalued ETF and short on the overvalued ETF. The trade is exited if a pair converges or after 20 days (if the pair does not converge within the next 20 business days). Pairs are weighted equally, and the portfolio is rebalanced on a daily basis.",0.349,15.80%
67,Industry Momentum – Riding Industry Bubbles,"The investment universe consists of equity industry funds (or ETFs), which are proxy for equity industry indexes. An investor uses ten years of past data to calculate the industry’s alpha based on the CAPM model (from the regression model industry_return = alpha + beta*market return, it is possible to use alternative models like the Fama/French 3 factor model). A bubble in an industry is detected if the industry’s alpha is statistically significant (academic source paper uses a 97,5% significance threshold, but it is possible to use other values). The investor is long in each industry experiencing a bubble by applying 1/N rule (investment is divided equally between industries in a bubble). If no bubble is detected, then he/she makes no investment. Data examination, alpha calculation, and portfolio rebalancing is done monthly.",0.181,33.20%
71,Short Term Reversal with Futures,"The investment universe consists of 24 types of US futures contracts (4 currencies, five financials, eight agricultural, seven commodities). A weekly time frame is used – a Wednesday- Wednesday interval. The contract closest to expiration is used, except within the delivery month, in which the second-nearest contract is used. Rolling into the second nearest contract is done at the beginning of the delivery month.

The contract is defined as the high- (low-) volume contract if the contract’s volume changes between period from t-1 to t and period from t-2 to t-1 is above (below) the median volume change of all contracts (weekly trading volume is detrended by dividing the trading volume by its sample mean to make the volume measure comparable across markets).

All contracts are also assigned to either high-open interest (top 50% of changes in open interest) or low-open interest groups (bottom 50% of changes in open interest) based on lagged changes in open interest between the period from t-1 to t and period from t-2 to t-1. The investor goes long (short) on futures from the high-volume, low-open interest group with the lowest (greatest) returns in the previous week. The weight of each contract is proportional to the difference between the return of the contract over the past one week and the equal-weighted average of returns on the N (number of contracts in a group) contracts during that period.",-0.098,67.10%
75,Federal Open Market Committee Meeting Effect in Stocks,"The investor is invested in stocks during FOMC meetings (going long S&P 500 ETF, fund, future, or CFD on a close one day before the meeting and closing position on close after the meeting). Otherwise, he is invested in cash during the remaining days. The strategy has very low exposure to the stock market (8 days during the average year); therefore, it can be very easily leveraged to gain very significant returns.",0.419,8.80%
77,Betting Against Beta Factor in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of all stocks from the CRSP database. The beta for each stock is calculated with respect to the MSCI US Equity Index using a 1-year rolling window. Stocks are then ranked in ascending order on the basis of their estimated beta. The ranked stocks are assigned to one of two portfolios: low beta and high beta. Securities are weighted by the ranked betas, and portfolios are rebalanced every calendar month. Both portfolios are rescaled to have a beta of one at portfolio formation. The “Betting-Against-Beta” is the zero-cost zero-beta portfolio that is long on the low-beta portfolio and short on the high-beta portfolio. There are a lot of simple modifications (like going long on the bottom beta decile and short on the top beta decile), which could probably improve the strategy’s performance.",,
78,Betting Against Beta Factor in International Equities,"The investment universe consists of all country ETFs. The beta for each country is calculated with respect to the MSCI US Equity Index using a 1-year rolling window. ETFs are then ranked in ascending order based on their estimated beta. The ranked ETFs are assigned to one of two portfolios: low beta and high beta. Securities are weighted by the ranked betas, and the portfolios are rebalanced every calendar month. Both portfolios are rescaled to have a beta of one at portfolio formation. The “Betting-Against-Beta” is the zero-cost zero-beta portfolio that is long on the low-beta portfolio and that shorts the high-beta portfolio. There are a lot of simple modifications (like going long on the bottom beta decile and short on the top beta decile), which could probably improve the strategy’s performance.",0.138,37.90%
80,Earnings Announcement Premium,"The investment universe consists of all stocks from the CRSP database. At the beginning of every calendar month, stocks are ranked in ascending order on the basis of the volume concentration ratio, which is defined as the volume of the previous 16 announcement months divided by the total volume in the previous 48 months. The ranked stocks are assigned to one of 5 quintile portfolios. Within each quintile, stocks are assigned to one of two portfolios (expected announcers and expected non-announcers) using the predicted announcement based on the previous year. All stocks are value-weighted within a given portfolio, and portfolios are rebalanced every calendar month to maintain value weights. The investor invests in a long-short portfolio, which is a zero-cost portfolio that holds the portfolio of high volume expected announcers and sells short the portfolio of high volume expected non-announcers.",s,19.10%
83,Pre-Holiday Effect,"Investors use some simple investment vehicles to gain exposure to US equity market (ETF, fund, CFD or future) only during days preceding holiday days (New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President’s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Election Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day). Investors stay in cash during other trading days. The anomaly isn’t limited only to the US market but seems to work well also in other countries; therefore, it could be broadened to include pre-holiday days for local holidays in other markets.",0.291,13.50%
85,Momentum in Mutual Fund Returns,"The investment universe consists of equity funds from the CRSP Mutual Fund database. This universe is then shrunk to no-load funds (to remove entrance fees). Investors then sort mutual funds based on their past 6-month return and divide them into deciles. The top decile of mutual funds is then picked into an investment portfolio (equally weighted), and funds are held for three months. Other measures of momentum could also be used in sorting (fund’s closeness to 1 year high in NAV and momentum factor loading), and it is highly probable that the combined predictor would have even better results than only the simple 6-month momentum.",0.257,38.00%
88,52-Weeks High Effect in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ (the research paper used the CRSP database for backtesting). The ratio between the current price and 52-week high is calculated for each stock at the end of each month (PRILAG i,t = Price i,t / 52-Week High i,t). Every month, the investor then calculates the weighted average of ratios (PRILAG i,t) from all firms in each industry (20 industries are used), where the weight is the market capitalization of the stock at the end of the month t. The winners (losers) are stocks in the six industries with the highest (lowest) weighted averages of PRILAGi,t. The investor buys stocks in the winner portfolio and shorts stocks in the loser portfolio and holds them for three months. Stocks are weighted equally, and the portfolio is rebalanced monthly (which means that 1/3 of the portfolio is rebalanced each month).",0.104,66.00%
91,Momentum Factor and Style Rotation Effect,"Russell’s ETFs for six equity styles are used (small-cap value, mid-cap value, large-cap value, small-cap growth, mid-cap growth, large-cap growth). Each month, the investor calculates 12-month momentum for each style and goes long on the winner and short on the loser. The portfolio is rebalanced each month.",-0.021,49.20%
96,Crude Oil Predicts Equity Returns,"Several types of oil can be used (Brent, WTI, Dubai, etc.) without big differences in results. The source paper for this anomaly uses Arab Light crude oil. Monthly oil returns are used in the regression equation as an independent variable, and equity returns are used as a dependent variable. The model is re-estimated every month, and observations of the last month are added. The investor determines whether the expected stock market return in a specific month (based on regression results and conditional on the oil price change in the previous month) is higher or lower than the risk-free rate. The investor is fully invested in the market portfolio if the expected return is higher (bull market); he invests in cash if the expected return is lower (bear market).",,
100,Trading WTI/BRENT Spread,"A 20-day moving average of WTI/Brent spread is calculated each day. If the current spread value is above SMA 20, then we enter a short position in the spread on close (betting that the spread will decrease to the fair value represented by SMA 20). The trade is closed at the close of the trading day when the spread crosses below fair value. If the current spread value is below SMA 20, then we enter a long position betting that the spread will increase, and the trade is closed at the close of the trading day when the spread crosses above fair value.",-0.007,49.00%
102,Option-Expiration Week Effect,Investors choose stocks from the S&P 100 index as his/her investment universe (stocks could be easily tracked via ETF or index fund). He/she then goes long S&P 100 stocks during the option-expiration week and stays in cash during other days.,0.279,15.60%
108,Soccer Clubs’ Stocks Arbitrage,"The investment universe consists of liquid soccer clubs’ stocks that are publicly traded. The investor then sells short stocks of clubs that play UEFA Championship matches (or other important matches) at the end of the business day before the match. Stocks are held for one day, and the portfolio of stocks is equally weighted (if there are multiple clubs with matches that day).",0.574,47.50%
113,January Barometer,"Invest in the equity market in each January. Stay invested in equity markets (via ETF, fund, or futures) only if January return is positive; otherwise, switch investments to T-Bills.",0.291,29.70%
118,Time Series Momentum Effect,"The investment universe consists of 24 commodity futures, 12 cross-currency pairs (with nine underlying currencies), nine developed equity indices, and 13 developed government bond futures.

Every month, the investor considers whether the excess return of each asset over the past 12 months is positive or negative and goes long on the contract if it is positive and short if negative. The position size is set to be inversely proportional to the instrument’s volatility. A univariate GARCH model is used to estimated ex-ante volatility in the source paper. However, other simple models could probably be easily used with good results (for example, the easiest one would be using historical volatility instead of estimated volatility). The portfolio is rebalanced monthly.",0.658,28.20%
122,Momentum Factor Combined with Asset Growth Effect,"The investment universe consists of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks (data for the backtest in the source paper are from Compustat). Stocks with a market capitalization less than the 20th NYSE percentile (smallest stocks) are removed. The asset growth variable is defined as the yearly percentage change in the balance sheet total assets. Data from year t-2 to t-1 are used to calculate asset growth, and July is the cut-off month. Every month, stocks are then sorted into deciles based on asset growth, and only stocks with the highest asset growth are used. The next step is to sort stocks from the highest asset growth decile into quintiles, based on their past 11-month return (with the last month’s performance skipped in the calculation). The investor then goes long on stocks with the strongest momentum and short on stocks with the weakest momentum. The portfolio is equally weighted and is rebalanced monthly. The investor holds long-short portfolios only during February-December -> January is excluded as this month has been repeatedly documented as a negative month for a momentum strategy (see “January Effect Filter and Momentum in Stocks”).",0.04,88.10%
125,12 Month Cycle in Cross-Section of Stocks Returns,"The top 30% of firms based on their market cap from NYSE and AMEX are part of the investment universe. Every month, stocks are grouped into ten portfolios (with an equal number of stocks in each portfolio) according to their performance in one month one year ago. Investors go long in stocks from the winner decile and shorts stocks from the loser decile. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced every month.",0.45,91.10%
129,Dollar Carry Trade,"The investment universe consists of currencies from developed countries (the Euro area, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). The average forward discount (AFD) is calculated for this basket of currencies (each currency has an equal weight). The average 3-month rate could be used instead of the AFD in the calculation. The AFD is then compared to the 3-month US Treasury rate. The investor goes long on the US dollar and goes short on the basket of currencies if the 3-month US Treasury rate is higher than the AFD. The investor goes short on the US dollar and long on the basket of currencies if the 3-month US Treasury rate is lower than the AFD. The portfolio is rebalanced monthly.",0.174,26.00%
130,Investment Factor,"The investment universe consists of all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks. Firstly, stocks are allocated to five Size groups (Small to Big) at the end of each June using NYSE market cap breakpoints. Stocks are allocated independently to five Investment (Inv) groups (Low to High) still using NYSE breakpoints. The intersections of the two sorts produce 25 Size-Inv portfolios. For portfolios formed in June of year t, Inv is the growth of total assets for the fiscal year ending in t-1 divided by total assets at the end of t-1. Long portfolio with the highest Size and simultaneously with the lowest Investment. Short portfolio with the highest Size and simultaneously with the highest Investment. The portfolios are value-weighted.",0.666,36.00%
136,Residual Momentum Factor,"The investment universe consists of all domestic, primary stocks listed on the New York (NYSE), American (AMEX), and NASDAQ stock markets with a price higher than $1. Closed-end funds, REITs, unit trusts, ADRs, and foreign stocks are removed. The 10% largest stocks in terms of market capitalization are then selected for trading.

The residual momentum strategy is defined as a zero-investment top-minus-bottom decile portfolio based on ranking stocks every month on their past 12-month residual returns, excluding the most recent month, standardized by the standard deviation of the residual returns over the same period. Residual returns are estimated each month for all stocks over the past 36 months using a regression model. The regression model is calculated every month for all eligible stocks using the Fama and French three factors as independent variables. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced monthly.",0.228,39.00%
140,Ramadan Effect,"The investment universe consists of countries for which stock market index data are available and in which the proportion of the population professing Muslim faith exceeded 50%. Most of the countries could be easily tracked via index ETFs. The research paper we use as an example uses 14 Muslim countries.

Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is based on the motion of the moon. The Ramadan month could be calculated by using the information on the lunar phases and sunset times from the astronomical calendar or information about Ramadan dates from various public sources.

The trading strategy is simple. The investor holds an equally weighted portfolio of ETFs during the Ramadan month. He/she is otherwise invested in cash.",0.013,11.40%
144,Trend-following Effect in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of US-listed companies. A minimum stock price filter is used to avoid penny stocks, and a minimum daily liquidity filter is used to avoid stocks that are not liquid enough. The entry signal occurs if today’s close is greater than or equal to the highest close during the stock’s entire history. A 10-period average true range trailing stop is used as an exit signal. The investor holds all stocks which satisfy the entry criterion and are not stopped out. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced daily. Transaction costs of 0.5% round-turn are deducted from each trade to account for estimated commission and slippage.",,
152,Momentum Factor Effect in REITs,"The investment universe consists of all US REITs listed on markets. Every month, the investor ranks all available REITs by their past 11-month return one-month lagged and groups them into equally weighted tercile portfolios. He/she then goes long on the best performing tercile for three months. One-third of the portfolio is rebalanced this way monthly, and REITs are equally weighted.

This is not the only way to capture the momentum factor in REITs as a consequential portfolio could be formed as a long/short or from quartiles/quintiles/deciles instead of terciles or based on different formation and holding periods (additional types of this strategy are stated in the “Other papers” section).",0.544,63.80%
155,Momentum and Reversal Combined with Volatility Effect in Stocks,"The investment universe consists of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks with prices higher than $5 per share. At the beginning of each month, the sample is divided into equal halves, at the size median, and only larger stocks are used. Then each month, realized returns and realized (annualized) volatilities are calculated for each stock for the past six months. One week (seven calendar days) prior to the beginning of each month is skipped to avoid biases due to microstructures. Stocks are then sorted into quintiles based on their realized past returns and past volatility. The investor goes long on stocks from the highest performing quintile from the highest volatility group and short on stocks from the lowest-performing quintile from the highest volatility group. Stocks are equally weighted and held for six months (therefore, 1/6 of the portfolio is rebalanced every month).",0.371,65.80%
162,Momentum Effect in Stocks in Small Portfolios,"The investment universe consists of all UK listed companies (this is the investment universe used in the source academic study, and it could be easily changed into any other market – see Ammann, Moellenbeck, Schmid: Feasible Momentum Strategies in the US Stock Market). Stocks with the lowest market capitalization (25% of the universe) are excluded due to liquidity reasons. Momentum profits are calculated by ranking companies based on their stock market performance over the previous 12 months (the rank period). The investor goes long in the ten stocks with the highest performance and goes short in the ten stocks with the lowest performance. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced yearly. We assume the investor has an account size of 10 000 pounds.",0.229,62.50%
198,Exploiting Term Structure of VIX Futures,"The trading strategy is using VIX futures as a trading vehicle and S&P mini for hedging purposes. The investor sells (buys) the nearest VIX futures with at least ten trading days to maturity when it is in contango (backwardation) with a daily roll greater than 0.10 (less than -0.10) points and holds it for five trading days, hedged against changes in the level of spot VIX by (long) short positions in E-mini S&P 500 futures. The daily roll is defined as the difference between the front VIX futures price and the VIX, divided by the number of business days until the VIX futures contract settles, and measures potential profits assuming that the basis declines linearly until settlement. The hedge ratios are constructed from regressions of VIX futures price changes on a constant and on contemporaneous percentage changes of the front mini-S&P 500 futures contract both alone and multiplied by the number of days to the settlement of the VIX futures contract (see equation 3 on page 12).",0.126,97.00%
199,ROA Effect within Stocks,"The investment universe contains all stocks on NYSE and AMEX and Nasdaq with Sales greater than 10 million USD. Stocks are then sorted into two halves based on market capitalization. Each half is then divided into deciles based on Return on assets (ROA) calculated as quarterly earnings (Compustat quarterly item IBQ – income before extraordinary items) divided by one-quarter-lagged assets (item ATQ – total assets). The investor then goes long the top three deciles from each market capitalization group and goes short bottom three deciles. The strategy is rebalanced monthly, and stocks are equally weighted.",,
207,Value Factor – CAPE Effect within Countries,"The investment universe consists of 32 countries with easily accessible equity markets (via ETFs, for example). At the end of every year, the investor calculates Shiller’s “CAPE” Cyclically Adjusted PE) ratio, for each country in his investment universe. CAPE is the ratio of the real price of the equity market (adjusted for inflation) to the 10-year average of the country’s equity index (again adjusted for inflation). The whole methodology is explained well on Shiller’s home page (http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) or http://turnkeyanalyst.com/2011/10/the-shiller-pe-ratio/). The investor then invests in the cheapest 33% of countries from his sample if those countries have a CAPE below 15. The portfolio is equally weighted (the investor holds 0% cash instead of countries with a CAPE higher than 15) and rebalanced yearly.",0.396,52.80%
229,Earnings Quality Factor,"The investment universe consists of all non-financial stocks from NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq.

Big stocks are defined as the largest stocks that make up 90% of the total market cap within the region, while small stocks make up the remaining 10% of the market cap. Investor defines breakpoints by the 30th and 70th percentiles of the multiple “Earnings Quality” ratios between large caps and small caps.

The first “Earnings Quality” ratio is defined by cash flow relative to reported earnings. The high-quality earnings firms are characterized by high cash flows (relative to reported earnings) while the low-quality firms are characterized by high reported earnings (relative to cash flow).

The second factor is based on return on equity (ROE) to exploit the well-documented “profitability anomaly” by going long high-ROE firms (top 30%) and short low-ROE firms (bottom 30%).

The third ratio – CF/A (cash flow to assets) factor goes long firms with high cash flow to total assets.

The fourth ratio – D/A (debt to assets) factor goes long firms with low leverage and short firms with high leverage.

The investor builds a scored composite quality metric by computing the percentile score of each stock on each of the four quality metrics (where “good” quality has a high score, so ideally a stock has low accruals, low leverage, high ROE, and high cash flow) and then add up the percentiles to get a score for each stock from 0 to 400. He then forms the composite factor by going long the top 30% of small-cap stocks and also large-cap stocks and short the bottom 30% of the small-cap stocks and also large-cap stocks and cap-weighting individual stocks within the portfolios.

The final factor portfolio is formed at the end of each June and is rebalanced yearly.",-0.18,94.90%
237,Dispersion Trading,"The investment universe consists of stocks from the S&P 100 index. Trading vehicles are options on stocks from this index and also options on the index itself. The investor uses analyst forecasts of earnings per share from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S) database and computes for each firm the mean absolute difference scaled by an indicator of earnings uncertainty (see page 26 in the source academic paper for detailed methodology). Each month, investor sorts stocks into quintiles based on the size of belief disagreement. He buys stocks with the highest belief disagreement and sells the index put is an equally-weighted portfolio of 1-month index put options with Black-Scholes deltas ranging from -0.8 to – 0.2.",,
238,Reversal in Post-Earnings Announcement Drift,"The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ with active options market (so mostly large-cap stocks). Each day investor selects stocks which would have earnings announcement during the next working day. He then checks the abnormal performance of these stocks during the previous earnings announcement. Investor goes long decile of stocks with the lowest abnormal past earnings announcement performance and goes short stocks with the highest abnormal past performance. Stocks are held for two days, and the portfolio is weighted equally.",-0.231,53.70%
271,Earnings Announcements Combined with Stock Repurchases,"The investment universe consists of stocks from NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq (no ADRs, CEFs or REITs), bottom 25% of firms by market cap are dropped. Each quarter, the investor looks for companies that announce a stock repurchase program (with announced buyback for at least 5% of outstanding stocks) during days -30 to -15 before the earnings announcement date for each company. Investor goes long stocks with announced buybacks during days -10 to +15 around an earnings announcement. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced daily.",-0.16,0.70%
281,Skewness Effect in Commodities,"The investment universe consists of 27 futures contracts on commodities. Each month, investor calculates skewness (3rd moment of returns) from daily returns from data going 12 months into the past for all futures. Commodities are then sorted into quintiles and investor goes long quintile containing the commodities with the 20% lowest total skewness and short quintile containing the commodities with the 20% highest total skewness (over a ranking period of 12 months). The resultant portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced each month.",0.745,40.00%
290,Consistent Momentum Strategy,"The investment universe consists of stocks listed at NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, whose price data (at least for the past seven months) are available at the CRSP database. The investor creates a zero-investment portfolio at the end of the month t, longing stocks that are in the top decile in terms of returns both in the period from t-7 to t-1 and from t-6 to t, while shorting stocks in the bottom decile in both periods (i.e. longing consistent winners and shorting consistent losers). The stocks in the portfolio are weighted equally. The holding period is six months, with no rebalancing during the period. There is a one-month skip between the formation and holding period.",0.054,85.30%
307,Reversal During Earnings-Announcements,"The investment universe consists of stocks listed at NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, whose daily price data are available at the CRSP database. Earnings-announcement dates are collected from Compustat. Firstly, the investor sorts stocks into quintiles based on firm size. Then he further sorts the stocks in the top quintile (the biggest) into quintiles based on their average returns in the 3-day window between t-4 and t-2, where t is the day of the earnings announcement. The investor goes long on the bottom quintile (past losers) and short on the top quintile (past winners) and holds the stocks during the 3-day window between t-1, t, and t+1. Stocks in the portfolios are weighted equally.",-0.032,39.60%
376,Combining Fundamental FSCORE and Equity Short-Term Reversals,"The investment universe consists of common stocks (share code 10 or 11) listed in NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ exchanges. Stocks with prices less than $5 at the end of the formation period are excluded.

The range of FSCORE is from zero to nine points. Each signal is equal to one (zero) point if the signal indicates a positive (negative) financial performance. A firm scores one point if it has realized a positive return-on-assets (ROA), positive cash flow from operations, a positive change in ROA, a positive difference between net income from operations (Accrual), a decrease in the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, a positive change in the current ratio, no-issuance of new common equity, a positive change in gross margin ratio and lastly a positive change in asset turnover ratio. Firstly, construct a quarterly FSCORE using the most recently available quarterly financial statement information.

Monthly reversal data are matched each month with a most recently available quarterly FSCORE. The firm is classified as a fundamentally strong firm if the firm’s FSCORE is greater than or equal to seven (7-9), fundamentally middle firm (4-6) and fundamentally weak firm (0-3). Secondly, identify the large stocks subset – those in the top 40% of all sample stocks in terms of market capitalization at the end of formation month t. After that, stocks are sorted on the past 1-month returns and firm’s most recently available quarterly FSCORE. Take a long position in past losers with favourable fundamentals (7-9) and simultaneously a short position in past winners with unfavourable fundamentals (0-3). The strategy is equally weighted and rebalanced monthly.",0.166,81.50%

460,ESG Level Factor Investing Strategy,"As we have previously mentioned, the choice of the database of ESG scores can alter results. This paper uses for the assessments of environment, social, and governance performance of single firms database provided by Asset4. Scores are updated every year, therefore to obtain monthly ESG data, the scores remain unchanged until the next assessment.

The investment universe consists of stocks of the North America region (Canada and the United States) that have ESG scores available. Stocks with a price of less than one USD are excluded. Paper examines the returns as abnormal returns according to the methodology of Daniel et al. (1997). Such methodology controls for risk factors such as size, book-to-market ratio, and momentum. The idea is to match a stock along with the mentioned factors to a benchmark portfolio that contains stocks with similar characteristics. Therefore, for the North America region, we have 4×4 benchmark portfolios. The abnormal return is calculated as the return of stock minus the return of stock´s matching benchmark portfolio return (equation 1, page 13).

Finally, each month stocks are ranked according to their E, S and G scores. Long top 20% stocks of each score and short the bottom 20% stocks of each score. Therefore, we have one complex strategy that consists of three individual strategies (for representative purposes; the paper examines each strategy individually). The strategy is equally-weighted: both stocks in the quintiles and individual strategies. The strategy is rebalanced yearly.",0.84,3.50%
461,ESG Factor Momentum Strategy,"The investment universe consists of stocks in the MSCI World Index. Paper uses MSCI ESG Ratings as the ESG database. The ESG Momentum strategy is built by overweighting, relative to the MSCI World Index, companies that increased their ESG ratings most during the recent past and underweight those with decreased ESG ratings, where the increases and decreases are based on a 12-month ESG momentum. The paper uses the Barra Global Equity Model (GEM3) for portfolio construction with constraints that can be found in Appendix 2. Therefore, this strategy is very specific, but we aim to present the idea, not the portfolio construction. The strategy is rebalanced monthly.",0.25,4.30%
522,"ESG, Price Momentum and Stochastic Optimization","The investment universe consists of large US stocks for which OWL Analytics ESG data were provided. Firstly, consider a scaled total ESG score, that is between zero and one, and classical equity 12-months momentum signal where the last month is omitted. The knapsack problem consists of finding the combination of objects (stocks) that maximize the value, given the condition of the maximal weight. In the case of ESG-MOM strategy (a strategy that wants the highest ESG stocks with the largest momentum), the weight is represented by the reversed value (absolute value of 1 minus ESG score) to ensure that the condition of maximal weight is meaningful. Maximal weight (weight cap) is set to be a sum of the top 10% of reversed ESG scores, which ensures that only top ESG stocks should be included. The value is represented by the ranked momentum, where the higher the rank of the stock is, the higher momentum is. The combination of weight, weight cap and value creates an optimization problem represented by equation 1 in the paper. The optimization problem is solved by the simulated annealing and results in the optimized long-only portfolio consisting of high ESG, high Momentum stocks. The strategy is equally-weighted and rebalanced monthly.",,
537,The Positive Similarity of Company Filings and Stock Returns,"The investment universe consists of stocks with large market cap covered by the Brain Company, for which stock prices were available to download from Yahoo Finance and had full history during the sample period. Firstly, only the similarity of the positive language is considered. The positive similarity score is calculated as the cosine similarity and is provided by the Brain Company. Each month, stocks are ranked based on the positive similarity language score of their most recent company filing and sorted into deciles. Long the bottom decile and short the top decile. The strategy is equally-weighted and rebalanced monthly.",,
578,Combining Smart Factors Momentum and Market Portfolio,"The investment universe consists of factors from the Alpha Architect’s Factor Investing Data Library (factor for all major investment styles such as Value, Quality, Momentum, Size and Volatility) based on the top 1500 US stocks. Firstly construct the fast and slow signals for each factor. The fast signal is the past one-month return, and the slow signal is the past twelve-months return. For each type of signal, to obtain the weights, cross-sectionally rank signals’ based on their absolute values. The weight for the individual slow or fast signal is equal to the corresponding rank divided by the sum of all ranks and multiplied by the signal’s sign (equations 3 and 4 in the paper). For the dynamically blended strategy (smart factors strategy), each factor has a final weight of three-quarters of the weight of fast signal plus one-quarter of the weight of slow signal (equation 12). Nextly, consider the top 1500 US stocks as the market portfolio. The combined smart factors and market strategy finds the weights of the market and factor portfolio using past moving averages of the returns. The combined strategy looks back on the past twelve months, and twelve MAs of the returns. Suppose the MA for active investing (factor momentum) is larger than MA for market portfolio, then the active investing scores one point. Otherwise, the market portfolio gets one point. Therefore, each month, the weight of the factor momentum and market portfolio is determined by the number of “winning” (loosing) moving averages (equations 13 and 14). The strategy is rebalanced monthly.",0.436,12.20%
